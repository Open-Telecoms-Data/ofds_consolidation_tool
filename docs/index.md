# OFDS Consolidation Tool

This is a [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) plugin to consolidate (deduplicate, combine) data from two networks of spans and nodes represented in the [Open Fibre Data Standard](https://open-fibre-data-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Using the tool - quickstart guide

For more detail on any of these steps, see the [how to guide](howto).

1. Add your nodes and spans geoJSON files as Vector Layers in QGIS (optionally add map tiles; make sure the map is at the bottom of the layers).
2. Start and configure the consolidation tool. Click through each presented pair of nodes and spans, and mark them as "Same" or "Not Same". Click "Finish" when you've compared them all.
3. Configure how much provenance metadata you want to keep with the output, then save the output.

Both the input and the output of the tool should be OFDS conformant geoJSON.
